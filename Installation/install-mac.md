# Installing Git on Mac

Git may already be installed on your Mac. You can check by opening **Terminal** and typing:

```bash
git --version
If Git is installed, you will see the version number, e.g.:

git version 2.42.0
If Git is not installed, follow one of the options below:

Option 1: Using Homebrew (Recommended)
Install Homebrew if you don’t have it:

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
Install Git via Homebrew:

brew install git
Verify installation:

git --version
Option 2: Using Git Installer
Go to the official Git website:
https://git-scm.com/download/mac

Download the latest version of the Git installer for Mac.

Open the downloaded .dmg file and follow the installation steps.

Verify installation:

git --version
✅ Notes
After installation, you can start using Git from Terminal or VS Code integrated terminal.

Option 1 (Homebrew) is preferred because it is easier to update Git in the future.

If you want, I can **also create `install-windows.md`, `install-linux.md`, and `verify-git.md` in the same polished format** so all your **Installation folder files** are ready for GitHub.  

Do you want me to do that next?
